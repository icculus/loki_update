How to build the Loki Update Tool

Step 1.
Make sure you have up to date development libraries and headers for the
following packages:
 * GTk
 * libXML
 * libGlade
 * Ares

Tested versions of most of these libraries can be found in the "libs"
subdirectory.

Step 2.
Download the setupdb package and unpack it in the directory immediately
above this one.  Build it by running "./configure; make" in the setupdb
directory.

Step 3.
Build the Loki Update Tool by typing "make"

Step 4.
Read the documentation in "README" thoroughly.  Browse the source code. :)
